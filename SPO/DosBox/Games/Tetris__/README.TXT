The Plot
********
The object of the game is to arrange falling blocks into nice lines. When a
full line is created it will be removed and you will be rewarded with points.
The more lines you remove in one go, the higher score you achive. The more
lines you remove the faster the game will go, making it a little bit harder.
If you can't arrange the pieces good enough the window will soon be filled
with pieces and then the game will be over.

Playing Modes
*************
- 1 player modes
  Normal. Your average tetris. Play until you lose.
  Countdown. Achieve as many points you can during 25 lines.

- 2 player modes
  Versus. The object of the game will be to last longer than your opponent. 
  When removing 2 or more lines on your side, equal number of lines will 
  appear on your opponents side as penalty.
  Linehunt. Be the first one to remove the selectde number of lines. 
  A very fast game indeed.

Control
*******
- Default
  Use left and right arrows to steer current piece left and right. Lower it 
  by pressing down arrow. You can rotate the piece by using Ctrl and Alt for
  left and right rotaion. If playing two the oter player will use the keys 
  Q and W to rotate, F and H for left/right and G for down.

                        the blocks right.

START LEVEL             Determines on which level you wish to start. The 
                        higher the level, the faster the game.

START HEIGHT            By increasing this value you can add rubbish to the
                        botton of the playfield. This will make the game
                        harder. The higher the value the more rubbish.
