; Z resets the VGA font patterns for characters digit zero and capital O
;    to new values, such that neither has any slashes through them, or
;    dots in them.  We also reset the character set to EGA 8x14, causing
;    VGA screens to have 28 lines, and we set the screen to a color depending
;    on the day of week.

Z:
  CALL GOODZ          ; change the font pattern for letter O and digit 0
  SUB DX,DX           ; DH row 0, DL column 0
  MOV BH,0            ; display page number zero
  MOV AH,2            ; BIOS function number for SET_CURSOR_POSITION
  INT 010             ; reset the video screen page zero, cursor at upper left
DOW_FILL:
  MOV ES,BX,0B800     ; we will output directly to the color screen
  JMP COLOR_C         ; set the video screen to today's color

CHARHT EQU 14         ; we are working with the 8x14 character set
include COLOR.8       ; code for setting the screen to given color
