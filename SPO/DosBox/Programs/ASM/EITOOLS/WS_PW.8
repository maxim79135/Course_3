; WS_PW converts a file from an ancient, DOS-based WordStar format to
;    plain ASCII text.

; This program was written many years ago, and is probably no longer useful.
; I did not deem it worthwhile to bring it up-to-date and to comment it.
; I am including it because it was in an earlier version of EITOOLS.
