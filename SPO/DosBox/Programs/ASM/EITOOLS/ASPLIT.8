; ASPLIT is a tool that splits a list of words into 26 files, according
;    to the first letter of the word.  The single argument to ASPLIT is the
;    pathname of the file to receive all words beginning with "a".  The path
;    must end with the letter "a".  The 25 other files, ending with "b"
;    through "z" instead of "a", are also created.  Input is taken from
;    standard input, so that you can pipe to ASPLIT.

FSPRAY_CT EQU 26      ; we are creating 26 files
FSPRAY_1ST EQU 'A'    ; the first file had better end with "A"
FSPRAY_INC EQU 1      ; file names increment by 1

ASPLIT:
  MOV SI,081          ; point to our command tail
  CALL OPEN_FSPRAY    ; scan name and open the 26 output files
  CALL NO_MORE_ARGS   ; insure that there are no more arguments
  CALL PROCESS_LINES  ; process the entire input file
  CALL CLOSE_FSPRAY   ; close all the output files
  JMP GOOD_EXIT       ; go back to the operating system


; PROCESS_LINE is called by PROCESS_LINES for each line received.  We
;   copy the line to the appropriate buffer, depending on the first
;   letter of the line.

PROCESS_LINE:
  MOV AL,[SI]               ; fetch the first letter of the line
  OR AL,020                 ; coerce the letter to lower-case
  SUB AL,'a'                ; reduce lower-case letters range to 0
  CBW                       ; extend index value AL to AX
  CMP AL,26                 ; was it in fact a lower case letter?
  IF B JMP W_FSPRAY         ; jump if it was, to copy the line
  MOV AX,NON_WORD_MSG       ; bad line seen: point to message
  JMP ERROR_EXIT            ; report the error and exit
