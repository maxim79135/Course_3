; MAKAVAIL is a diagnostic tool that reduces available memory to the number
;   of kilobytes given as a decimal value in the command tail.

MAKAVAIL:
  MOV SI,081          ; point to our command tail
  CALL VERIFY_1_DEC   ; fetch the number of K we want to reduce to
  INC AX              ; fudge factor
  SHL AX,CL,6         ; convert to a number of paragraphs
  MOV DX,W[2]         ; point DX beyond available memory
  SUB DX,AX           ; reduce DX to a future start of available memory
  MOV AX,SS           ; fetch the current start of available memory
  SUB DX,AX           ; calculate the number of paragraphs we need to use up
  JC >L5              ; error if the total is less than zero
  MOV AX,03100        ; DOS function codes for EXIT_TSR
  INT 021             ; exit program, leaving enough resident memory

L5:                   ; there is already less than the indicated amount
  MOV AX,ALREADY_MSG  ; point to message saying so
  JMP ERROR_EXIT      ; output the message and exit the program
