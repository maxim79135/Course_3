; MEMWRITE outputs to standard output the region of memory whose segment
;   location and length (less than 64K) are given as command tail arguments.

MEMWRITE:
  MOV SI,081          ; point to the invocation command tail
  CALL VERIFY_HEX     ; set AX to the segment address
  PUSH AX             ; save the segment address
  CALL VERIFY_HEX     ; set AX to the output length
  XCHG CX,AX          ; swap the output length into CX
  CALL NO_MORE_ARGS   ; insure that there are just 2 hex arguments
  POP DS              ; restore the segment address to DS
  SUB DX,DX           ; writing always starts at offset 0 within the segment
  CALL OWRITE         ; output the memory contents to standard output
  JMP GOOD_EXIT       ; return to the operating system
