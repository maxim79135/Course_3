; JOINDENT joins any indented lines to the previous line, by reducing
;   the intervening CRLF and indentation to a single space.

; This program assumes the output is small enough to fit into a
; single buffer.  If it isn't, the CRLF-retract code might retract
; back before the current output buffer.
