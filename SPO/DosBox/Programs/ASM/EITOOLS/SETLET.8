; SETLET sends a sequence of formatting codes to an HP Laserjet printer,
;   for printing a business letter on standard paper.

; This program was written before the fancy, Windows-based word processors
; that figure out all the printer codes for you.

MAIN:
  MOV DX,PRN_NAME   ; point to the printer's device name
  MOV AX,03D01      ; MSDOS codes for "open for writing"
  INT 021           ; call MSDOS to open the printer device
  XCHG BX,AX        ; swap the printer's open-file handle into BX
  MOV DX,CODES      ; point to the codes we are outputting
  MOV CX,LENGTH     ; load the number of code bytes
  MOV AH,040        ; MSDOS code for "write"
  INT 021           ; write the codes to the printer
  MOV AX,04C00      ; MSDOS codes for "successful process termination"
  INT 021           ; go back to the operating system

PRN_NAME:           ; device name for opening the printer output stream
  DB 'PRN',0

CODES:
  DB 01C            ; code for 96 characters per line
  DB 01B,038        ; code to set 8 lines per inch
  DB 01B,'%C001'    ; codes to reset the left margin to the left edge
LENGTH EQU $-CODES
