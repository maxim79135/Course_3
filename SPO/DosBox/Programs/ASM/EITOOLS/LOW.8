; LOW is a line filter that converts all letters in a file to lower-case.

; Minor note: since the word LOW is an A86 built-in keyword, it cannot
;   be used as the label for the start of the program.  Hence, we invoke
;   the LINE_FILTER macro with the operand LOW_ having a trailing
;   underscore.

LINE_FILTER LOW_        ; this program is a line filter

PROCESS_LINE:           ; process each line: CX bytes at SI
  PUSH CX,SI            ; save the line count and pointer
  JCXZ >L3              ; skip if the line has no contents
L1:                     ; loop here to look at each byte of the line
  LODSB                 ; fetch a byte
  CMP AL,'A'            ; is it too low to be a letter?
  JB >L2                ; skip if it is
  CMP AL,'Z'            ; is it an upper-case letter?
  JA >L2                ; skip if it is not
  OR B[SI-1],020        ; convert the letter to lower-case
L2:
  LOOP L1               ; loop to look at the next character in the line
L3:
  POP SI,CX             ; restore line pointer and count
  JMP OUT_PROCESS_LINE  ; output the resulting line
