;---------------

; SUB2 accepts 4 string arguments in its invocation command tail.  We search
;  for the first instance of the first string in standard input, and substitute
;  the second string.  We then search for the next instance of the third string
;  and substitute the fourth string. Then we repeat the process, until standard
;  input is exhausted.  We output the resulting filtered text to standard
;  output.

;  The reason why SUB2 was written was to make substituions for PC-Write
;  control codes, which surround the text they apply to.  We wish to substitue
;  different values for the left-codes than for the right-codes; and SUB2 lets
;  us do so.

;  The string arguments can contain control characters, as determined by the
;  filtering mechanism in SCAN_STRING, described in the procedure-level
;  documentation.
