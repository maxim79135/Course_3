; LINESG outputs all lines whose length is greater than or equal to a
;   specified number.  The length is given as the only command-tail argument.

USAGE_MSG:
  DB 'usage, e.g.: LINESG 20 <in >out',0D,0A
  DB '  outputs lines with 20 or more characters',0D,0A,0

ONE_DEC:
  CALL VERIFY_1_DEC   ; verify that there is a decimal argument in command tail
  XCHG DX,AX          ; swap the argument value into DX
  INC DX,2            ; advance count to include CRLF terminators of lines
  RET

PROCESS_LINE:           ; filter CX bytes from SI--DI to BP
  CMP CX,DX             ; does the line exceed the proscribed length?
  JB RET                ; return if not: the line is not passed on
  JMP OUT_PROCESS_LINE  ; the line is long enough: output it
