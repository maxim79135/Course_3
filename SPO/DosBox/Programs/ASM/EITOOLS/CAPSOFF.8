; CAPSOFF turns the CapsLock light off on the keyboard.

; We exploit the fact that a COM program always starts with a zero pushed
;   onto the stack, to reduce this program to only three instructions!

CAPSOFF:
  POP DS            ; point DS to the zero segment
  AND B[0417],0BF   ; turn off the CapsLock bit
  JMP 0             ; exit the program
