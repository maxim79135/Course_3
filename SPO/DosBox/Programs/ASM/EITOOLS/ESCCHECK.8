; ESCCHECK returns an exit code of 1 if the Esc key was the last one
;   physically pressed.  You can follow ESCCHECK with IF ERRORLEVEL 1 EXIT
;   in a batch file, to allow escaping at a controlled time.

ESCCHECK:
  IN AL,060           ; fetch the scan code directly from the hardware
  AND AL,07F          ; mask away the keyup/keydown bit
  CMP AL,1            ; is it the code for the Esc key?
  IF NE MOV AL,0      ; if not then return and exit code of zero
  MOV AH,04C          ; DOS function code for EXIT_PROGRAM
  INT 021             ; exit the program
