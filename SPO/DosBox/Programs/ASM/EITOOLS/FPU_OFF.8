; FPUOFF was written during the brouhaha over the floating-point bug
; in the very first Pentium chips.  Someone was selling a program on
; Compuserve that "fixed" the problem by completely disabling the 
; floating-point processor!  This program is my response: an 8-byte
; COM file.

FPUOFF:
  POP DS            ; tricky way to get zero into the DS register
  AND B[0410],0FD   ; turn off the BIOS flag for the floating-point unit
  INT 32            ; exit back to the operating system
