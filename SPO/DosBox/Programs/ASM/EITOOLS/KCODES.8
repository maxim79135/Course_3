; KCODES displays the hex value of the keyboard input port, every time
;   it changes.  The hex words are output directly to the start of
;   text-mode VGA/EGA/CGA video memory.

; The program continues indefinitely, until the user holds down the Esc
; key and presses the q key.

KCODES:
  MOV ES,AX,0B800     ; point ES to the video screen
  MOV DS,AX,040       ; point DS to the BIOS keyboard buffer area
  SUB DI,DI           ; point to the start of video memory
L1:                   ; loop here to continuously monitor the key port
  MOV [01A],AX,[01C]  ; empty the BIOS keyboard buffer
  IN AL,060           ; fetch a value from the keyboard input port
  MOV BH,AL           ; save the value in BH
  CMP BX,01001        ; do we have Esc and q both held down?
  JE RET              ; return to the operating system if we have
  CMP AL,BL           ; has the port value changed?
  JE L1               ; loop if it hasn't, to continue monitoring
  MOV BL,AL           ; value has changed: store the new value
  CALL VIDEO_HEXOUT   ; output the AL value to video memory
  JMP L1              ; loop to continue monitoring the port
