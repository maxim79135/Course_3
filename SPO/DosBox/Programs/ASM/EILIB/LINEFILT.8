; LINE_FILTER is a macro that can be included at the beginning of a program,
;   to make that program into a line filter.  The first operand to LINEFILT
;   is the name of the program; the optional second operand is the name
;   of the procedure to be called to scan the invocation command tail, and
;   to make any initializations necessary prior to processing.

; The second operand can also be the single character "-", in which case
; there is no initialization procedure, but the LINE_FILTER call should
; immediately be followed by DB directives with the null-terminated
; trailing part of USAGE_MSG.
