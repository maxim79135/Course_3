; WILD_BP_ACT calls the BP action routine once for every file conforming
;   to the SI-pointed wildcard specification.  BP is called with DX pointing
;   to the name of the individual file to be processed.  We leave the DI
;   register untouched, for the BP routine to maintain as it chooses.

WILD_BP_ACT:
  PUSH DI,BP            ; save registers across call
  SUB CX,CX             ; we will copy all the stack to the the end of SS
  CALL WILD_ARGS        ; expand wildcard specifications in the command tail
  POP BP,DI             ; restore clobbered regsiters
  JCXZ RET              ; skip if there were no arguments
L1:                     ; loop here to pop and process each file name
  LODSW                 ; fetch the file name pointer
  XCHG DX,AX            ; swap the pointer into DX, for DOS's convenience
  PUSH CX,SI,BP         ; save our pointers count, pointer, and action pointer
  CALL BP               ; call the action routine supplied by our caller
  POP BP,SI,CX          ; restore clobbered registers
  LOOP L1               ; loop to process another file
  RET
