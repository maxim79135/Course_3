; SKIP1 and SKIP2 are macros that effect a fast version of a JMP instruction,
;   around the next 1 or 2 bytes in the program instruction stream.  We
;   generate the opcodes for CMP AL,ib or CMP AX,iw, which clobber the flags
;   but occupy less space and execute more quickly than JMP $+3 or JMP $+4
;   would.

; SS_CALL makes a CALL to a user-supplied library routine.  We determine if
;   the routine is a memory variable , and, if it is, we prepend an SS
;   override byte to the CALL instruction.

SKIP1 MACRO         ; skip over the next one-byte instruction
  DB 03C            ; CMP AL,ib opcode consumes the next instruction byte
#EM

SKIP2 MACRO         ; skip over the next two-byte instruction
  DB 03D            ; CMP AX,iw opcode consumes the next instruction byte
#EM


SS_CALL MACRO
        ##if (TYPE #1) EQ 2
  SS                  ; supply override if this is an indirect call
        ##endif
  CALL #1             ; invoke caller's procedure
#EM
