; COPY_TAIL copies the program's command tail from SI to our local buffer, and
;   points SI to the first character of the copy.  We assume DS=ES=CS.  We
;   clobber CX and DI.

; This routine is provided to protect against the possibility of the command
; tail getting clobbered by DOS.  In reality, there are very few DOS functions
; that actually use that space.

COPY_TAIL:
  MOV CX,63         ; we'll move one byte plus 63 words
  MOV DI,L1         ; point to our buffer, for output
  PUSH DI           ; save the output pointer
  REP MOVSW         ; move the 63 words
  MOVSB             ; move the one byte
  POP SI            ; restore our buffer's pointer to SI
