; PAGE_CAP_DI is called with DI pointing beyond a buffer of bytes about
;   to be printed.  We strip all trailing blanks and control characters
;   from the buffer, then append a CR and a formfeed, to insure a
;   page-eject without any unneccessary trailing blank material.

L1:                     ; loop here to retract trailing blanks and controls
  DEC DI                ; retreat the output pointer
PAGE_CAP_DI:
  CMP B[DI-1],' '       ; is this byte still a blank or control?
  JBE L1                ; loop if it is, to retreat some more
  MOV AX,0C0D           ; load CR and formfeed
  STOSW                 ; output a trailing CRFF
  RET
