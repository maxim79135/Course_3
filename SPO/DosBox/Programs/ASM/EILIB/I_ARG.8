; OPEN_I_ARG expects SI to point to some part of the command tail.  We
;   skip leading blanks, and open for reading the file named by the
;   following argument.  We return with AX=BX=IHANDLE= the open file handle.
;   If anything went wrong we jump to USAGE_EXIT.

; MOPEN_IHANDLE opens the DX-pointed file for reading, and stores the handle
;   in IHANDLE.

        DATA SEGMENT
  IHANDLE  DW ?     ; open file handle for the input file
        DATA ENDS

OPEN_I_ARG:
  CALL FILE_ARG     ; scan the first file name
  JC >E1            ; error if there was no name
MOPEN_IHANDLE:
  CALL MOPEN_READ   ; open the first file
  JC >E1            ; error if the file was not found
  MOV IHANDLE,AX    ; set IHANDLE to the input file

E1:                 ; something went wrong
  JMP USAGE_EXIT    ; abort the program
