;---------------

; USAGE_EXIT outputs the null-terminated message USAGE_MSG to the error
;   console, then exits the program.  The message must be supplied by the
;   caller.

; EMSG_USAGE_EXIT outputs the CS:AX-pointed message, followed by USAGE_MSG,
;   and then exits the program.

; ERROR_EXIT outputs the CS:AX-pointed message, and exits the program.

; NONBLANK_TAIL ensures that there is a nonblank command tail at DS:081.  If
;   the command tail is blank, we exit with USAGE_MSG.

  CALL EMESSAGE       ; output the exiting error message
  JMP BAD_EXIT        ; exit the program with a non-zero error code
        #endif
