; ISEG_LOCOUT outputs to DI the file location of pointer AX, given that
;   the last file read ended at ISEG_LOCEND, and the total number of file
;   bytes read are given by the 32-bit quantity at ISEG_LOC.  The output
;   is formatted as an 8-digit hex number, with leading zeroes.

ISEG_LOCOUT:
  SS SUB AX,ISEG_LOCEND W   ; compute the negative adjustment-offset
  SS MOV DX,ISEG_LOC W      ; load the low word of the file byte count
  ADD AX,DX                 ; calculate the adjusted offset
  SS MOV DX,ISEG_LOC+2 W    ; fetch the high word of the file byte count
  ADC DX,-1                 ; carry the negative addition into the high word
  CALL HEX_DXAX             ; output the 8-digit hex value
  MOV AL,' '                ; load blank, for caller's convenience
  RET
