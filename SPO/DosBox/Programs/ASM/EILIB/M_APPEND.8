; MOPEN_APPEND opens for writing the file whose path name is pointed to by
;   DS:DX, and seeks to the end of that file.  We return with BX set to the
;   open-file handle of the file, and DXAX set to the current size of the file.

MOPEN_APPEND:
  MOV AX,03D01      ; MS-DOS function code for OPEN FOR WRITE
  INT 021           ; open the file for writing
  XCHG BX,AX        ; swap the handle into BX
  IF C CALL MCREAT  ; if it wasn't open then create it
  SUB CX,CX         ; high word of seek offset is zero
  SUB DX,DX         ; low word of seek offset is zero
  MOV AX,04202      ; MS-DOS function codes for "SEEK FROM END OF FILE"
  INT 021           ; move to the end of the file, and set DXAX to the size
