; WILD_MODBAK is called to transform the SI-pointed list of files using
;   the MODBAK procedure.  The caller must declare OBUFF and associated
;   symbols, and provide the procedure MODBAK_REC, as described in
;   MODBAK.8.  The list of files can include wildcard characters.

WILD_MODBAK:
  SUB CX,CX         ; copy the entire stack up to the 0000 top
  CALL WILD_ARGS    ; parse the filenames and point SI to their pointers
  JZ RET            ; return if there were no filenames
L1:                 ; loop here to process each file
  LODSW             ; fetch the pointer to the file
  PUSH CX,SI        ; save the pointers count and pointer
  XCHG SI,AX        ; swap this path pointer into SI
  CALL MODBAK       ; process the file
  POP SI,CX         ; restore the pointers pointer and count
  LOOP L1           ; loop to process the next file
  RET
