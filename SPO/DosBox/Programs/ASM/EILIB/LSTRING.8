; LSTRING_AX outputs to DI-pointed memory the CS:AX-pointed string.  The
;   string consists of a length byte, followed by the number of characters
;   indicated by the length byte.

LSTRING_AX:
  PUSH DS,CX        ; preserve registers across call
  MOV DS,CS         ; point to our own program's segment
  XCHG SI,AX        ; swap pointer into SI
  XCHG CX,AX        ; swap caller's SI into CX
  LODSB             ; load the length of the message
  CBW               ; extend the length AL to AX
  XCHG AX,CX        ; restore caller's CX, swap caller's SI back to AX
  REP MOVSB         ; output the string
  XCHG SI,AX        ; restore caller's SI
  POP CX,DS         ; restore caller's CX and DS
  RET
