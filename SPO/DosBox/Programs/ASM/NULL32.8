; Here is a do-nothing 32-bit application that can be invoked
; from the DOS prompt running under Win95.  Thanks to Jeremy Gordon
; for writing the short instruction sequence, and for working with
; me to get it running.

; For some reason unknown to us, the code segment *must* have the
; name _TEXT, or else the program will generate a protection fault.

; This source file NULL32.8 can be assembled, then linked to Borland's
; KERNEL32.LIB library using Borland's Turbo Linker for Win32, Version
; 1.50, using the commands:

;    A386 +oc NULL32.8
;    TLINK32 /Tpe /ap NULL32.OBJ,NULL32,,KERNEL32.LIB,,

; The program file NULL32.EXE is produced, which can be run simply by
; typing NULL32 to the DOS prompt.
