          types, folder view and file sorting modes;

        - long file name support (optional);

        - transparent archive managament functions;

     How to START:

     - Unpack FAR distribution package into an apparent folder,
       for instance C:\FAR

     - initiate the Run command of C:\FAR\FAR

     - FAR will start for your pleasure.


     Alternatively, after unpacking FAR package, you may enter
