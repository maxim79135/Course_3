This is additional information for the FAR version 1.0 beta.


Hints and known problems:

1. To process archives FAR calls external archiver tools.
   Archiver command lines are defined in the file Archiver.Ini
   located in the FAR folder. In case you installed the final
   release of the RAR Archiver v2.0 for Windows, you may change 
   the '-r' switch to '-r0' in the [rar] archiver section for 
   better perfomance.

2. If you wanted to add FAR to your Start menu of Windows 95,
   it would be useful to add FAR.BAT with FAR.EXE call,
   instead of adding FAR.EXE itself. It will help you to save
   properties.

3. When critical error occurs while execution of DOS application
   started with FAR, choose "Fail" instead of "Abort", when you
   prompted by critical error handler. Otherwise, in some cases
   FAR will not be able to continue after the application is 
   terminated. The problem is known for Windows 95 only. Windows NT
   users will not run into this.

4. If you wish to use Windows Paste from clipboard whithin the FAR 
   editor, uncheck the "Fast pasting" option in FAR properties. 
   Paste and Copy operations are implemented in the editor as well
   with usage of common Windows clipboard (see also "Block commands"
   in the Editor's help).
