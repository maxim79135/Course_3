 - [new] added support for parsing (and understanding) versions with a single letter suffix (eg. 1.0a, 3.4c, etc),
 - [new] optimized memory management - storing packages metadata consumes 2x to 3x less memory now (with current FreeDOS repositories, FDNPKG memory consumption dropped from 192 KB to 64 KB),
 - [new] added a test checking the writeability of %TEMP% before proceeding to any actions,
 - [new] additional check for ZIP archives pre-validation: reject files that lack a central directory entry (because it's probably a truncated archive),

 - [new] lowered the stack memory required by fdnpkg from 1M to 512K (this was possible due to recent reimplementation of zip and http modules),

FDNPKG v0.95 [11 Jul 2013]
 - [fix] when updating a package, the new candidate is downloaded and checked before the current package is removed from the system (before we could end with our package being removed and none installed if the download failed on the new one),
 - [fix] remote package is not downloaded anymore if it's already installed (unless we want to update it),
 - [new] replaced the embedded UNZIP kludge by my own unzip implementation,
 - [new] replaced the embedded htget kludge by my own, lighter & simpler http implementation,
 - [new] the directory %DOSDIR%\packages is created automatically when installing the first package,

 - [new] added gopher support for online repositories storage,
 - [new] added support for LZMA-compressed packages,
 - [new] added a progress feedback when downloading files, so in case of big packages taking a long time to download, the user don't think anymore that fdnpkg freezed,
 - [new] added the possibility to update all packages in the system to latest version at once (if newer versions are available), via 'fdnpkg update',
 - [new] renamed the 'showinstalled' action to 'listlocal', as the latter is shorter/faster to type (but 'showinstalled' still works for backward compatibility),
 - [new] refactored the whole networking code to make it much easier to integrate other tcp/ip stacks in the futur (mTCP maybe, if it makes it into the 32bit world?).

 - [fix] FDNPKG is quitting if networking (Watt32) fails to initialize (was trying to continue anyway, possibly leading to crashes),

 - [new] added support for custom configuration file location via the FDNPKG.CFG environnement variable.

FDNPKG v0.93a [20 Feb 2013]
 - [fix] fixed a minor bug related to paths parsing, which made installing packages from local zip files failing in some situations (thanks to sparky4 for reporting this).

FDNPKG v0.93 [17 Feb 2013]
 - [fix] the CRC32 algorithm used for internal FDNPKG needs has been fixed to compute the same CRC32 sums as used by ethernet,

 - [new] implemented configurable custom directories for different packages types (games, devel...),

 - [new] storing absolute paths to installed files and directories in packages\*.lst listing files,
 - [new] replaced the 'listrep' action by 'dumpcfg'.

FDNPKG v0.92 [31 Jan 2013]
 - [fix] fixed a bug in handling the tmp index in hardcoded c:\temp instead of relying on %TEMP% (thanks to Rugxulo and Bernd Blaauw for reporting this!),

 - [new] FDNPKG checks for the presence of an APPINFO file prior to installing the package (thanks to sparky4 for the suggestion),
 - [new] added the install-nosrc action allowing to install packages without their sources,
 - [new] implemented a local package database cache to speed up searching through packages,
