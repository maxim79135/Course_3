
Stuff that I might do some day...

- switch the TCP stack to use picoTCP
- make it possible to install sources for a package that was installed without sources
- for a given on-disk file, make it possible to check if it belongs to a package
- (?) look for %DOSDIR%\PACKAGES\%PKGNAME%\REMOVE.BAT and INSTALL.BAT scripts
- optimize db-related operations (creating db, loading it from file), to speed up the process
- look for FDNPKG.CFG first in current EXE dir instead of in %DOSDIR%/BIN (but %FDNPKG.CFG% should still have priority over everything else)
- add a way to install a specific version of a package without relying on the latest version autodetection (fdnpkg install pkgname/0.50)
- when the connection to network fails, we should continue with what we have (looks like wattcp is calling exit() if it fails to get an IP via DHCP?)
- "fdnpkg refresh" to force a repo refresh
